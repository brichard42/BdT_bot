# BdT_bot

Small python script to reserve a ticket for a festival.
DISCLAIMER: I did this little bot to help a friend out getting his ticket. Also to have a little funny python project ðŸ¤“

## What it does

 - Requires subscription to a push notification canal on your phone via scanning a QR code
 - Iterates on Festival's ticket resale page to reserve a festival ticket and notifies you once found

## Requirements

I recommand installing Conda for python package management and creating an environment with:
- Selenium (conda install selenium)
- notify_run (pip install notify_run)

But you can proceed as you want as long as those two are available for the script to run.
